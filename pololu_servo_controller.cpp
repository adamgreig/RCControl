* \param servo The servo number to configure.
* \param on whether The servo should be turned on.
* \param direction What direction large positions send the servo.
* \param range what The position value is multiplied by.
* From the Pololu manual:
*  *  Bit 6 specifies whether a servo  is on or not; a 1  turns  the 
*  servo on, and a 0  (default)  turns  it off.
*  *  Bit 5  sets  the direction  the  servo moves, which only 
*  applies  to 7- and 8-bit position commands.   If  the bit  is 0 
*  (default), a  larger position number causes  the output 
*  pulse  to  get  bigger;  if  the  bit  is  1,  a  larger  position 
*  number will make  the output pulse  shorter.
*  *  Bits 0-4 set  the range  through which  the servo moves  in 
*  7-  and  8-bit  commands.   A  larger  value will  give  a 
*  larger range, and setting the range to 0 will make the 
*  servo always stay at neutral.  Given the same range setting, an 8-bit command will 
*  move the servo through twice the range of a 7-bit command.   The default range 
*  setting  is 15, which will give approximately 180 degrees  in 8-bit commands and 90 
*  degrees  in 7-bit commands.
